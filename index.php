echo "After a fun trip to Miami, I'm back in Destin and ready for my 22nd Bootcamp to start in less than a week. It's amazing to me how time flies - I so clearly remember my first Bootcamp class and it doesn't seem like it was that long ago! But when I look at those early videos and slides, I'm pleased to see how much the course has improved: we've made a lot of great additions to the content, trimmed the fat, and made an excellent product overall. Of course, a big part of the improvements have come from my experiences as a trader. Like all serious traders, I work hard to constantly learn and grow and perfect my craft. Today was one of those days where things were just clicking; we have been able to capitalize on the volatility in the market and lock down some crazy gains - $4700 today!  ";
