echo "After a fun trip to Miami, I'm back in Destin and ready for my 22nd Bootcamp to start in less than a week. It's amazing to me how time flies - I so clearly remember my first Bootcamp class and it doesn't seem like it was that long ago! But when I look at those early videos and slides, I'm pleased to see how much the course has improved: we've made a lot of great additions to the content, trimmed the fat, and made an excellent product overall.
